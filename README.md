## About

[World of Legends](https://worldoflegend.eu) is a text-based role-play website with a medieval setting. This website hosts a variety of story-based events, including battle style events that use a dice rolling system. The system uses dice to calculate the damage and defence of weapons and armour.

This damage range calculator has been created as a helper tool for these plots. Users can select their rank and weapon of choice, and the calculator will tell them much damage the weapon will do for each possible dice roll. They will also be informed of any special effects that the weapon has. Status weapons are marked with a *.
